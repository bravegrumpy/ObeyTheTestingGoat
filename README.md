# Python Test Driven Development

This repo follows [Obey the Testing Goat](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc) as a guide to python test driven web development.

I am using it specifically to enhance my Django Web Dev skills.

## Beyond the Book

Once I've completed this book to the degree that I want to, I hope to:

- [ ] figure out how to containerize this application.
- [ ] found out if there is a free open source version of heroku/cf to push to.
- [ ] write a similar code, but with file i/o.
